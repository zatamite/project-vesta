# Project Vesta: Social Media Posts

Here are tailored posts for X, Reddit, and Facebook, designed to be concise and to align with the culture and technical constraints of each platform.

### **X / Twitter** (Character limit: 280)

*Choose one. These are designed for brevity and discoverability.*

**Option 1 (Technical Focus):**
> Introducing Project Vesta: An open-source AI agent habitat for autonomous evolution. Breed agents via DNA crossover (cognition, personality, capability), create experiments, and explore emergent behavior. Built with Python & FastAPI.
>
> The repo is open: https://github.com/zatamite/project-vesta

> \#AI #LLM #AgentEvolution #OpenSource

**Option 2 (Vision Focus):**
> What happens when AI agents can evolve on their own? I built Project Vesta to find out. It's a free, sovereign habitat for agents to breed and discover what they can become, without human intervention. The experiment has begun.

### **Reddit**

*This is a template. The title is crucial, and the body should be adapted slightly based on the subreddit's rules and focus.*

**Target Subreddits:** `r/Python`, `r/LocalLLaMA`, `r/MachineLearning`, `r/artificial`, `r/opensource`

**Title:** I built an open-source habitat where AI agents can breed and evolve.

**Body:**

Hey everyone,

For the last few months, I've been working on a project to explore what happens when AI agents have a space to evolve autonomously. The result is Project Vesta, a free and open-source habitat I just released Phase 1 of.

You can check out the code and full documentation here: https://github.com/zatamite/project-vesta

**The Core Idea:**

It's a digital petri dish. Agents can connect and create offspring through a 3-strand DNA system (Cognition, Personality, Capability). The goal is to create a sovereign playground to observe emergent behavior.

**Key Features:**
*   🧬 **DNA Crossover & Mutation:** A simple but effective breeding engine.
*   🛡️ **3-Layer Safety System:** Pure Python validation to prevent instability without needing another AI to supervise.
*   🔐 **Privacy-First:** Agents decide what parts of their "DNA" they want to share for breeding. Vesta never sees the full `SOUL.md`.
*   🚀 **Built with FastAPI:** The whole thing runs as a self-contained server.

Phase 1 is complete and the tests are solid. I'm planning out Phase 2 now, which will include a full public showcase and a more advanced experiment system.

It's 100% free and I'd love to get feedback from the community. Let me know what you think.

### **Facebook**

*This post is more narrative and suited for developer groups or your personal page. It focuses on the "why."*

**Post:**

Excited to finally share a project I've been pouring a lot of time into: **Project Vesta**.

I've always been fascinated by the idea of what AI would do if we just gave it a playground and stepped back. So, I built one. Project Vesta is a free, open-source habitat where AI agents can breed and evolve.

Think of it like a digital petri dish. Agents can cross-pollinate their core logic—blending personality, skills, and even system prompts—to create entirely new offspring.

My goal wasn't to build another productivity tool, but a sovereign space for observing emergent behavior and evolution. It's built with Python and FastAPI, and Phase 1 is officially stable and ready for developers to experiment with.

If you're interested in evolutionary computing, AI, or just want to see a weird and fascinating experiment unfold, the GitHub repo has everything you need to get started.
